## My Goal?

My goal is to build this website in a **modern, clean, and scalable way**, and slowly grow it into a **smart system for the library**.

I want the system to:
- Automatically track when users enter and leave the library  
- Show the admin who is currently inside, in real time  
- Keep clear in-time and out-time records for every user  
- Help the owner understand daily and monthly usage through simple analytics  
- Show new users which seats or slots are available before they join  
- Use heatmaps and data insights to understand peak hours and activity patterns  

The vision is to **reduce manual work**, **bring clarity**, and **make the library easier to manage**, while keeping the experience simple and smooth for students.

This is just the beginning — many more useful features will be added as the project grows.
